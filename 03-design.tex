\chapter{Design}

Describe the high-level design of your system.
It makes sense to start with a subchapter for the problem statement.
Mention any attacker models, assumptions, and constraints of your system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item start with a theoretical approach
    \item describe the developed system/algorithm/method from a high-level point of view
\end{itemize}
