\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Provide the background information needed to understand your work.
Goal should be that any random cs student on the campus should be able to understand your work.
You don't need to explain the very basis, e.g., how a linked list works, but should explain concepts you use that are not taught in the basic courses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item comment on employed hardware and software
    \item describe methods and techniques that build the basis of your work
\end{itemize}
