\section{Sample Section}

The following samples explain how to insert cross-references, figures and tables, how to set math, algorithms and program code, how to add references, and how to use acronyms.


\subsection{Cross References}
\label{sec:cross-ref}

Use the \verb|\label| and \verb|\cref| commands for cross references, e.g.\ to \cref{sec:cross-ref}. 

\subsection{Figures}

\Cref{fig:setup0} shows the distribution of the nodes in the sample setup at time $t=0$, as well as the initial coverage with a sensing radius of \SI{30}{\metre} and the communication graph for a communication range of \SI{50}{\metre}.
Figure captions should always be placed at the bottom of the figure.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/coverage-30--0-static1}
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/connectivity-50-0-static1}
	\caption{Coverage and connectivity for a sample replication at time $t=0$}
	\label{fig:setup0}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Subfigures}

\Crefrange{fig:setup1}{fig:setup2} show the distribution of the nodes in the sample setup at time $t=0$, as well as the initial coverage with a sensing radius of \SI{30}{\metre} and the communication graph for a communication range of \SI{50}{\metre}.

\begin{figure}%
	\centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/coverage-30--0-static1}
      \caption{coverage}\label{fig:setup1}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/connectivity-50-0-static1}
      \caption{connectivity}\label{fig:setup2}
    \end{subfigure}
	\caption{Subfigures showing coverage and connectivity for a sample replication at time $t=0$}%
	\label{fig:setups12}%
\end{figure}

\subsection{Plotting}

Plotting is an important part of every evaluation.
In general, the user has to major options there: Either using an external application to generate plots, or to use an integrated, \LaTeX{}-native plotting solution.


Popular external applications include gnuplot\footnote{\url{http://www.gnuplot.info/}}, matplotlib\footnote{\url{https://matplotlib.org/stable/}} or ggplot2\footnote{\url{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/}}.
If using one of those, please make sure to export the plots as either \TeX{} (if available) or at least vector graphics such as PDF, and do not use bitmap graphics.

You can also make \LaTeX{} generate plots automatically using \texttt{gnuplot}.
Just put your data into a \texttt{csv} file in the \texttt{plots} subdirectory and create a \texttt{gnuplot} script ending in \texttt{.gplt}.
Follow the example from \texttt{plots/ass\_granularity.gplt}\ifthenelse{\boolean{gnuplot}}{ shown in Figure \ref{fig:AssGran}}{}.
To enable this feature, two steps are required

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Enable shell-escape in the file \verb!.latexmkrc!. See the comments there for details
	\item Pass the gnuplot option to the \verb!i4thesis! documentclass in \verb!thesis.tex!, i.e.\\\verb!\documentclass[...,gnuplot]{i4thesis}!
	\item See the example code below (hidden as long as gnuplot is disabled)
\end{enumerate}

\ifthenelse{\boolean{gnuplot}}{
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \vspace{\gnuplotpreskip}
  \tikzset{external/export=true}
  \tikzsetnextfilename{eval-ass_granularity}
  \input{plots/ass_granularity.tex}
  \tikzset{external/export=false}
  \vspace{\gnuplotcaptionskip}
  \caption{Prevalent assignment and scheduling on \emph{task} or \emph{subtask-level} compared to scheduling at the granularity of ABB for the same set of 12,812 random systems with up to 68 ABB.}
  \label{fig:AssGran}
  \vspace{\gnuplotundercaptionskip}
\end{figure}
}{}

Finally, the pgfplots\footnote{\url{http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/gallery.html}} package constitutes a fully \LaTeX{}-native solution to plot measurement data, and thus does not require external applications or the shell-escape feature. As this plotting happens in the context of your current document, it ensures a consistent styling and allows you to directly annotate datapoints by using Ti\textit{k}Z. However, due to the limits of the \TeX{}-engine, it might struggle with particularly large datasets.

\subsection{Tables}

\Cref{tab:SensorNetworkApplications} gives an overview of the discussed application classes.
In contrast to figure captions, table captions are always placed above the table.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Sensor network applications}
	\label{tab:SensorNetworkApplications}
	\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedright}p{1.8cm}p{5.4cm}p{3.4cm}}
		\toprule
		Class & application examples & lifetime aspects \\
		\midrule
		Critical, coverage & 
				Forest fire detection, flood detection, nuclear/chemical/biological attack detection, battlefield surveillance, intrusion detection & 
				$c_{ca}$/$c_{ct}$/$c_{cb}$, $c_{ln}$, $c_{la}$, $c_{lo}$\\
		Critical, no coverage & 
				Monitoring human physiological data, military monitoring of friendly forces, machine monitoring & 
				$c_{cc}$, $c_{ln}$, $c_{la}$, $c_{lo}$ \\
		Noncritical, coverage & 
				Agriculture, smart buildings, habitat monitoring (sensors monitor the inhabitants in a region) & 
				$c_{ac}$/$c_{tc}$/$c_{bc}$, $c_{cc}$, $c_{sd}$ \\
		Noncritical, no coverage & 
				Home automation, habitat monitoring (sensors are attached to animals and monitor their health and social contacts) & 
				$c_{cc}$, $c_{sd}$ 	\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Math}

Simple inlined equations: $\zeta(t) = \min( \zeta_{**}(t))$.
The same in a numbered equation, i.e.\ \cref{eq:zeta}:

\begin{equation}
\zeta(t) = \min( \zeta_{**}(t))
\label{eq:zeta}
\end{equation}

Equations covering multiple lines should be aligned. Note that the numbering is added automatically, independent of whether the equation is actually referenced or not:

\begin{align}
sd_{max} &= max((t_{i+1} - t_i) : \zeta(t_i) < 1, i \in [0, |T|-1]) \\
\psi_{sd}(t) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
\dfrac{\Delta t_{sd}}{sd_{max}} & sd_{max} > 0 \\
1 & sd_{max} = 0 \\
\end{array} \right.\\
\zeta_{sd}(t) &= \frac{\psi_{sd} - cl_{sd}}{c_{sd} - cl_{sd}}
\end{align}


\subsection{Units}

Units should be set using the \verb|\SI| command: the measurements show that the car was accelerating at \SI{5}{\metre\per\second\squared} until it reached its final speed of \SI{100}{\kilo\metre\per\hour}. Longer unitless numbers or ranges can be typeset using the \verb|\num| and \verb|\numrange| commands, respectively: The number \num{12345678} lies in the range of \numrange{10000000}{20000000}. The value \SI{4.1(2)}{\meter} is not exactly measured. \Cref{tab:si-in-tables} gives an example of how to typeset numbers and units in tables.
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{EMIT factors for a category 9 vehicle}
	\label{tab:si-in-tables}
	\begin{tabular}{l>{\raggedright}p{4cm}S[table-text-alignment=left,table-format=1.4e-1]s}
	\toprule
		\multicolumn{2}{l}{factor} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{value} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{unit} \\
	\midrule
		$M$ & vehicle mass & 1.3250e+3 & \kilo\gram \\
		$g$ & gravitational constant & 9.81 & \metre\per\second\squared \\
		$\vartheta$ & road grade & 0 & \degree \\
 		$\alpha$ & & 1.1100 & \gram\per\second \\
 		$\delta$ & & 1.9800e-6 & \gram\per\meter\cubed\second\squared \\
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Algorithms}

Based on the periodically transmitted \texttt{hello} messages, the joining node gets information about its physical neighbors and their adjacent nodes. \Cref{alg:H_hello} depicts the handling of \texttt{hello} messages.

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Locally stored state of all neighbors in set $N$
\ENSURE Maintain neighbor set $N$ and set virtual address
\STATE Receive neighbor information from node $N_i$
\IF {$N_i \notin N$}
	\STATE $N \gets N_i$
\ELSE
	\STATE Update $N_i \in N$
\ENDIF
\IF {$P==-1$ AND (Time() $-$ OldTime) $> T_{ps}$}
	\STATE OldTime $\gets$ Time()
	\STATE SetMyPosition()
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Handle \texttt{hello} messages}
\label{alg:H_hello}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Program Code}

Program code should be omitted, but if absolutely necessary, it should be set as seen in \cref{lst:code}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=txt,caption=Sample application,label=lst:code]{}
APPLICATION("printU", 192, arg)
{
    // Set Priority
    NutThreadSetPriority(16);
    // main() loop
    for (;;) {
        putchar('U');
        NutSleep(125);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{References}

To further evaluate the applicability of our definition, we analyzed sensor network applications as surveyed in~\cite{akyildiz2002survey,arampatzis2005survey,khemapach2005survey}. Concerning the importance of different lifetime criteria, most of the application scenarios can be grouped into two main classes with two sub-classes each~\cite{dietrich2009lifetime}.


\subsection{Acronyms}

Acronyms should be explained when first used. Latex helps, e.g.\ \acp{MANET} have been frequently used as examples for the development of \ac{WSN} applications.

\subsection{References to Data}

With dataref, \LaTeX{}
provides a package to annotate data symbolically within the text. The
data is declared in \verb|data.tex| and can be used with the
\verb|\dref| macro and its companions. See the dataref documentation
for further examples.

\begin{quote}
  We concluded \dref{/experiment 1/base}
  experiments. \drefrel[prefix=/experiment 1,base=/base,factor,percent]{/a} percent of all experiments
  were successful.
\end{quote}

\subsection{TODOs and FIXMEs}

You can use the \verb|\TODO| command to add short ``sticky notes'' to your document. 
\TODO{This is what a TODO looks like}
This will also trigger generation of a list-of-TODOs at the end of the document. 
The same goes for the \verb|\FIXME| command.\FIXME{This is what a FIXME looks like}
Be careful when using \verb|\TODO| or \verb|\FIXME| near figures when using the gnuplot feature.

\subsection{TikZ}
