missions. They are currently deployed in a wide range of civil
applications as a sensor is becoming smaller and production costs are
smaller. The main drawback is the energy constraint as it seems
impractical to change or recharge the battery. Several applications
require an end-to-end reliable data transport with congestion control to
achieve an intended performance, especially during heavy traffic. This
paper provides a survey of wireless sensor networks technology. Several
research works including sensor network applications, components,
reliable transport protocols, and congestion control schemes are

	address = {Washington, DC},
	abstract = {Majority of papers in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have an element of energy-efficiency and associated with it an analysis of network lifetime. Yet, there is no agreement on how to analyze the lifetime of a WSN. As a result, errors are frequently made on both sides. Some underestimate the network lifetime by an order of magnitude, while others end up overestimating the lifetime by a significant factor. This paper presents a first step towards standardizing the lifetime analysis of WSNs. We focus on WSNs deployed for always-on applications, where the problem of power management is most severe because the environment needs to be monitored continuously. Underestimation of network lifetime is common when proposing sleep-wakeup schemes, where it is frequently assumed that in the absence of a sleep-wakeup scheme, a sensor node from the Mica family lasts 3-5 days on a pair of AA batteries. We show that the same sensor node can be made to last more than 36 days, even if it is continuously monitoring the environment. Overestimation typically occurs when proposing non-sleep-wake up power management schemes such as in-network data aggregation. Overestimation occurs because several network activities (e.g periodic routing messages) are assumed to have negligible effect on the network lifetime and therefore are ignored in the lifetime analysis. We use our recent experience in deploying ExScal (a large-scale WSN for intrusion detection) to identify major components in the network lifetime analysis. We then present a careful lifetime analysis of ExScal and show how to analyze the effects of using various non-sleep-wake up power management schemes such as hierarchical sensing, low-power listening, and in-network data aggregation on the network lifetime. Our lifetime analysis will be useful as a template in analyzing the lifetime of other WSNs deployed for always-on applications.},

	abstract = {An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. Furthermore, the network must be able to configure itself to any feasible degree of coverage and connectivity in order to support different applications and environments with diverse requirements. This article presents the design and analysis of novel protocols that can dynamically configure a network to achieve guaranteed degrees of coverage and connectivity. This work differs from existing connectivity or coverage maintenance protocols in several key ways. (1) We present a Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) that can provide different degrees of coverage requested by applications. This flexibility allows the network to self-configure for a wide range of applications and (possibly dynamic) environments. (2) We provide a geometric analysis of the relationship between coverage and connectivity. This analysis yields key insights for treating coverage and connectivity within a unified framework; in sharp contrast to several existing approaches that address the two problems in isolation. (3) We integrate CCP with SPAN to provide both coverage and connectivity guarantees. (4) We propose a probabilistic coverage model and extend CCP to provide probabilistic coverage guarantees. We demonstrate the capability of our protocols to provide guaranteed coverage and connectivity configurations through both geometric analysis and extensive simulations.},

	abstract = {Network lifetime has become the key characteristic for evaluating sensor networks in an application specific way. Especially the availability of nodes, the sensor coverage, and the connectivity have been included in discussions on network lifetime. Even quality of service measures can be reduced to lifetime considerations. A great number of algorithms and methods were proposed to increase the lifetime of a sensor network - while their evaluations were always based on a particular definition of network lifetime. Motivated by the great differences in existing definitions of sensor network lifetime that are used in relevant publications, we reviewed the state of the art in lifetime definitions, their differences, advantages, and limitations. This survey was the starting point for our work towards a generic definition of sensor network lifetime for use in analytic evaluations as well as in simulation models - focusing on a formal and concise definition of accumulated network lifetime and total network lifetime. Our definition incorporates the components of existing lifetime definitions, and introduces some additional measures. One new concept is the ability to express the service disruption tolerance of a network. Another new concept is the notion of time-integration: in many cases, it is sufficient if a requirement is fulfilled over a certain period of time, instead of at every point in time. In addition, we combine coverage and connectivity to form a single requirement called connected coverage. We show that connected coverage is different from requiring non-combined coverage and connectivity. Finally, our definition also supports the concept of graceful degradation by providing means of estimating the degree of compliance with the application requirements. We demonstrate the applicability of our definition based on the surveyed lifetime definitions as well as using some example scenarios to explain the various aspects influencing sensor network lifetime.},

	abstract = {The recent interest in sensor networks has led to a
number of routing schemes that use the limited resources
available at sensor nodes more efficiently. These schemes
typically try to find the minimum energy path to optimize
energy usage at a node. In this paper we take the view that
always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the
point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To
optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called
energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally
to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also
presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40%
over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes
also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network
ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.},
