\chapter{Evaluation}

Measurement results / analysis / discussion

\begin{itemize}
    \item whatever you have done, you must comment it, compare it to other systems, evaluate it
    \item usually, adequate graphs help to show the benefits of your approach
    \item caution: each result/graph must be discussed! What's the reason for this peak or why have you observed this effect 
\end{itemize}
